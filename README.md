## How to Use

1. Click `Use this template > Create a new repository` on GitHub or click [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=jekyll-class-blog&template_owner=mmore500).
2. Set the `Repository name` with the URL where the blog should appear.
   For example, choosing `repository-name` would result in the blog being served at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.
3. Click `Create Repository` at the bottom right of the repository creation page.
4. Navigate to the new repository's page, `https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name`
5. Click the `_config.yaml` file to open it.
   Then, click the pencil icon in the upper right ("Edit this file") to edit.
6. Change `url` field to `https://yourusername.github.io` (substituting your username).
7. Change `baseurl` field to `repository-name` (substituting your repository name).
8. Click the `Commit Changes` button in the top right, then `Commit Changes` on the confirmation panel that appears.
9. Navigate to the `Settings > Pages` pane of your repository page (`https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name/settings/pages`).
10. Set your deployment branch as `main` and your deployment directory as `/ (root)`.
11. Click the `enforce https` checkbox.
12. Wait about one minute for site build and deploy to complete.
   You can monitor this process from the `Actions` pane of the repository page (`https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name/actions`)
13. Once the deployment completes (green checkmark), your page should be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.
